**Para** is a scalable, multitenant backend server/framework for object persistence and retrieval.
It helps you build and prototype applications faster by taking care of backend operations.
It can be a part of your JVM-based application or it can be deployed as standalone, multitenant API server with
multiple applications and clients connecting to it.

The name "p√°ra" means "steam" in Bulgarian. And just like steam is used to power stuff, you can use
Para to power your mobile or web application backend.

See how **Para** [compares to other open source backend frameworks](https://erudika.com/blog/2015/10/21/backend-frameworks-usergrid-loopback-para-baasbox-deployd-telepat/).

**This project is fully funded and supported by [Erudika](https://erudika.com) - an independent, bootstrapped company.**

### Features

- RESTful JSON API secured with Amazon's Signature V4 algorithm
- Database-agnostic, designed for scalable data stores (DynamoDB, Cassandra, MongoDB, etc.)

## Documentation

### [Read the Docs](https://paraio.org/docs)

## Blog

### [Read more about Para on our blog](https://erudika.com/blog/tags/para/)

## Hosting

We offer **hosting and premium support** at [paraio.com](https://paraio.com) where you can try Para online with a
free developer account. Browse and manage your users and objects, do backups and edit permissions with a few clicks in
the web console. By upgrading to a premium account you will be able to scale you projects up and down in seconds and
manage multiple apps.

## Quick Start

1. [Download the latest executable JAR](https://github.com/Erudika/para/releases)
2. Create a configuration file `application.conf` file in the same directory as the JAR package.
3. Start Para with `java -jar -Dconfig.file=./application.conf para-*.jar`
4. Install [Para CLI](https://github.com/Erudika/para-cli) with `npm install -g para-cli`
5. Create a new dedicated app for your project and save the access keys:
```
# run setup and set endpoint to either 'http://localhost:8080' or 'https://paraio.com'
# the keys for the root app are inside application.conf
$ para-cli setup
$ para-cli new-app "myapp" --name "My App"
```
Alternatively, you can use the [Para Web Console](https://console.paraio.org) to manage data,
or integrate Para directly into your project with one of the API clients below.

## Docker

Tagged Docker images for Para are located at `erudikaltd/para` on Docker Hub.
**It's highly recommended that you pull only release images like `:1.45.1` or `:latest_stable`
because the `:latest` tag can be broken or unstable.**
First, create an `application.conf` file and a `data` folder and start the Para container:

```
$ touch application.conf && mkdir data
$ docker run -ti -p 8080:8080 --rm -v $(pwd)/data:/para/data \
  -v $(pwd)/application.conf:/para/application.conf \
  -e JAVA_OPTS="-Dconfig.file=/para/application.conf" erudikaltd/para:latest_stable
```

**Environment variables**

`JAVA_OPTS` - Java system properties, e.g. `-Dpara.port=8000`
`BOOT_SLEEP` - Startup delay, in seconds

**Plugins**

To use plugins, create a new `Dockerfile-plugins` which does a multi-stage build like so:
```
# change X.Y.Z to the version you want to use
FROM erudikaltd/para:v1.XY.Z-base AS base
FROM erudikaltd/para-search-lucene:1.XY.Z AS search
FROM erudikaltd/para-dao-mongodb:1.XY.Z AS dao
FROM base AS final
COPY --from=search /para/lib/*.jar /para/lib
COPY --from=dao /para/lib/*.jar /para/lib
```

Then simply run `$ docker build -f Dockerfile-plugins -t para-mongo .`

## Building Para

Para can be compiled with JDK 8+:

To compile it you'll need Maven. Once you have it, just clone and build:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/erudika/para.git && cd para
$ mvn install -DskipTests=true
```
To generate the executable "fat-jar" run `$ mvn package` and it will be in `./para-jar/target/para-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
Two JAR files will be generated in total - the fat one is a bit bigger in size.

To build the base package without plugins (excludes `para-dao-sql` and `para-search-lucene`), run:
```
$ cd para-jar && mvn -Pbase package
```

To run a local instance of Para for development, use:
```sh
$ mvn -Dconfig.file=./application.conf spring-boot:run
```

## Standalone server

You can run Para as a standalone server by downloading the executable JAR and then:

```sh
$ java -jar para-X.Y.Z.jar
```

The you can browse your objects through the **Para Web Console** [console.paraio.org](https://console.paraio.org).
Simply change the API endpoint to be your local server and connect your access keys.
The admin interface is client-side only and your secret key is never sent over the the network. Instead,
a JWT access token is generated locally and sent to the server on each request.

Alternatively, you can build a WAR file and deploy it to your favorite servlet container:
```
$ cd para-war && mvn package
```

## [Download JAR](https://github.com/Erudika/para/releases)

## Maven dependency

You can also integrate Para with your project by adding it as a dependency. Para is hosted on Maven Central.
Here's the Maven snippet to include in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.erudika</groupId>
  <artifactId>para-server</artifactId>
  <version>{see_green_version_badge_above}</version>
</dependency>
```

For building lightweight client-only applications connecting to Para, include only the client module:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.erudika</groupId>
  <artifactId>para-client</artifactId>
  <version>{see_green_version_badge_above}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Command-line tool

- **Para CLI**: [para-cli](https://github.com/erudika/para-cli)

```sh
$ npm install -g para-cli
```

## API clients

Use these client libraries to quickly integrate Para into your project:

- **Java**: [para-client](https://github.com/erudika/para/tree/master/para-client)
- **JavaScript / Node.js**: [para-client-js](https://github.com/erudika/para-client-js)
- **PHP**: [para-client-php](https://github.com/erudika/para-client-php)
- **Python**: [para-client-python](https://github.com/erudika/para-client-python)
- **C# / .NET**: [para-client-csharp](https://github.com/erudika/para-client-csharp)
- **Android**: [para-client-android](https://github.com/erudika/para-client-android)
- **Swift / iOS**: [para-client-ios](https://github.com/erudika/para-client-ios)

## Database integrations

Use these `DAO` implementations to connect to different databases:

- **DynamoDB**: `AWSDynamoDAO` (included in `para-server`)
- **MongoDB**: [para-dao-mongodb](https://github.com/Erudika/para-dao-mongodb)
- **Cassandra**: [para-dao-cassandra](https://github.com/Erudika/para-dao-cassandra)
- **SQL** (H2/MySQL/SQL Server/PostgreSQL, etc.): [para-dao-sql](https://github.com/Erudika/para-dao-sql)
`H2DAO` is the default `DAO` and it's part of the SQL plugin (packaged with the JAR file)

## Search engine integrations

The `Search` interface is implemented by:

- **Lucene**: [para-search-lucene](https://github.com/erudika/para-search-lucene) **default** (packaged with the JAR file)
- **Elasticsearch**: [para-search-elasticsearch](https://github.com/erudika/para-search-elasticsearch)
- **Elasticsearch v5.x**: [para-search-elasticsearch-v5](https://github.com/erudika/para-search-elasticsearch-v5)
Compatible with ES 5.x only and missing some of the latest features like AWS Elasticsearch support.

## Cache integrations

The `Cache` interface is implemented by:

- **Caffeine**: **default** objects are cached locally (included in `para-server`)
- **Hazelcast**: [para-cache-hazelcast](https://github.com/Erudika/para-cache-hazelcast) (distributed)

## Queue implementations

The `Queue` interface is implemented by:

- **AWS SQS**: in the `AWSQueue` class
- `LocalQueue` for single-host deployments and local development
